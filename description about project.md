Develop a GUI with the following features:
• Two modes to control the fan (Auto mode and Manual mode).
• In manual mode, the fan can be manually controlled.
• In auto mode, use a slider threshold to set the desired temperature level. The 
fan should turn on when the sensor value is higher than the threshold.
• Display the temperature sensor value in both modes.
• Indicate the fan status in both modes.
• Control the fan motor via the GUI.
• Create a log file to store sensor data, fan status data, and GUI mode. The log 
file may be in either CSV or Excel format
