## Features

1. **Read Temperature Sensor Values:**
   - Continuously monitor and display temperature sensor readings.

2. **GUI with Two Modes to Control the Fan:**
   - **Manual Mode:**
     - Allows direct manual control of the fan (on/off).
   - **Auto Mode:**
     - Uses a slider to set a desired temperature threshold.
     - The fan turns on automatically when the temperature exceeds the set threshold.

3. **Display Temperature Sensor Value:**
   - Real-time display of the current temperature sensor reading in both modes.

4. **Indicate Fan Status:**
   - Visual indication of the fan status (on/off) in both Auto and Manual modes.

5. **Control Fan Motor via GUI:**
   - Use the GUI to control the fan motor based on user inputs and sensor readings.

6. **Log File Creation:**
   - Create a log file to store sensor data, fan status, and GUI mode.
   - The log file can be in CSV or Excel format.
